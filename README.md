### Swap with Lit Actions playground

**Install**

```
yarn i 
yarn run start
```

This is an early demonstration of how to use Lit Actions to make swaps.

This leverages Sling Protocols' [pkp-dex-sdk](https://github.com/Sling-Protocol/pkp-dex-sdk) to generate transaction
data which is then signed using Lit Actions.
